# Applications based on the Möbius-Lechuga Strip for Satellite Attitude Control.
An innovative project to continue exploring the applications of the Möbius-Lechuga Strip, related to attitude actuators. 

## Year: 2024 - Present. 

## Description.

This project is a continuation of a previous work, avaible here: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370952991 , where the objective was to elaborate a technical proposal for increasing the redundancy of reaction wheel arrays in CubeSat satellites, by modifying their location inside the body. 

The results of that study showed the correct execution of the proposal, leaving the open question: <<is it possible to use it in other devices, such drones, rockets and aircrafts?>>. That question is looking to be answered in this work. 

## Expected product.
One published paper in a international journal.
